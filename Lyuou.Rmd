ggplot

```{r}
dog_bite %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gender, fill = spay_neuter)) + geom_bar() +
  labs(
    title = 'Number of dogs spayed/neutered by gender',
    x = 'Gender',
    y = 'Count'
  ) +

    labels = c('Female', 'Male', 'Unidentified')

plotly

```{r}
dog_bite %>% 
  group_by(gender, spay_neuter) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(text_label = str_c('Gender: ', gender, '\nnumber: ', n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~gender, y = ~n, color = ~spay_neuter, type = 'bar', text = ~text_label) %>% 
  layout(
     xaxis = list(text = c('Female', 'Male', 'Unidentified')),
     yaxis = list(title = "count"), barmode = "stack")
  



```

* We found that there are more Male and Unidentified dogs than female.  
* Among Male and Female dogs, the number of dogs that were spayed/neutered or unneutered are similar.  
* Among dogs whose gender are unidentified, most dogs were not spayed/neutered.
