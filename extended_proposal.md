#### Anticipated Title, Motivation, and Data

**Title** *I thought you said your dog did not bite!*

**Motivation** Pit bulls have a historically poor reputation as an aggressive breed. But in recent years, there's been a push to change this stigma. Based on the occurrence of dog bites, can we see whether pit bulls are more aggressive than other breeds, and whether this has changed over time?

**Data** [Dog bite data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-Dog-Bite-Data/rsgh-akpg) and [dog licensing data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Dog-Licensing-Dataset/nu7n-tubp) available on NYC Open Data. Google Drive containing datasets available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wZfIbv9UWAoI-YO1mwRgoXmU-ucr0inX).

#### Planned Analyses and Final Product

**Research questions:** - Are there more bites given by pit bulls than other breeds? - Does this number change by borough? Over time? - Are there more pitbulls in certain neighborhoods? - Do pit bulls tend to be spayed/neutered more or less often than other breeds? - How does the number of dog bites by breed compare to the total number of registered dogs in a certain time period? - Does season / weather affect the number of dog bites?
